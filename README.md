# Blox
Isometric Block Puzzle game coded in 8086 Assembly

This was the final project i have made in my Assembly class, the game mechanics is borrowed from the Miniclip game [Bloxorz](https://www.miniclip.com/games/bloxorz/en/). Basically The goal of the game is to navigate the rectagular block in an upright position to the finish tile.

Install Guide:

1. Download and Install Dosbox [here](https://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1)
2. Mount this directory as 'E' or any letter and run BLOX

```
Z:\> MOUNT E C:\Path\to\this\directory
Z:\> E:
E:\> BLOX
```
You can add the Mount lines under AUTOEXEC in the Dosbox config file to avoid typing mount every time Dosbox opens.

Compile Guide:
I have used Borland's Turbo Assembler to compile my assembly code which can be found in this [instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-run-TASM-and-Compile-x86-Assembly-Program-i/) also uploaded a copy in this rep for redundancy.

To Compile and Run

```
E:\> TASM BLOX
E:\> TLINK BLOX
E:\> BLOX
```
Level Creation:

![Image of Level Creation](blox_screenshots/level.png?raw=true "Level")

Levels in Blox consists of 27 rows (0-26), of which consists of 11 columns for even rows (0-10) and 10 columns for odd ones (0-9). Tiles can only be placed from rows 4 to 24 and columns 1 through 9 for both even and odd rows.

Tiles in this game are generated by lvl variables, level one is defined as: 
```
lvl1 dw 0H,0H,0H,0H,0H,0H,0100H,01D0H,03F0H,01F8H,01B8H,0014H,4H,84H,188H,198H,1B8H,1FCH,1D4H,0C2H,2H,0H,0H,0H,0H,0H,0H
```
a level is a 26 word array, wherein a word is corresponds to a row in the game. for example row 9 in level1 is valued `03F0H`
if we are to create a word in binary based from the image where white tiles are 1 and 0 for empty we would end up with `0000 0011 1111 0000B` or `03F0H` in hexadecimal.

Start and End Points:

Start and Endpoints are stored as values in an array in the following variables.
```
ar_strtrow db 20,22,16,20,6
ar_strtcol db 1,6,4,3,4
ar_endrow db 8,6,13,9,24
ar_endcol db 8,6,2,7,5
```
All first elements of the array belongs to level 1, second elements to level to and so on.
for level 1 the start tile would be (20,1) and end tile would be (8,8).
